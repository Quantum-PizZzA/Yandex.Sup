Petya poured soup with letters into the pot, but that's bad luck - the pot turned out to have holes around the edges, and the soup began to flow out. Each letter floats to the nearest hole and flows out of the pan. Help Petya see if he can save any of the letters, and write a function that calculates how many seconds it takes for all the letters to flow out of the pan.

It is believed that:

+ The letter approaches the hole one cell per second.
+ Letters do not interact with each other.
+ If the distance from the letter to several holes is the same, then the letter flows to the hole with the minimum number.
+ Each hole is signed with a unique number.
+ There can be several holes on one side, but all have unique coordinates.
+ The saucepan is a rectangle.
+ Time starts from second number 1.


module.exports = function(mapString: string): number {
    // Your code

    return timeInSec; // Time in seconds for all letters to leak out
}
Input Format
A string with a picture of the soup in the initial state.
